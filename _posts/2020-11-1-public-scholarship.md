title: The Importance of Studying Sex Differences
---

The study of sex differences often raises legitimate concern. Many scientific fields of the past have fallen victim to pseudoscience and conspiracy theorizing, likely due to the complex social motivations which have underpinned them - two notable examples of the distorting effect of these influences being the Soviet Union’s [Lysenkoism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41653570) and Nazi Germany’s [Aryanism](https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1096/fj.08-0202ufm). Given these risks, we must ask ourselves why we want to study sex differences at all, given their potential to be misunderstood by scientists and the public alike. What good could possibly come of it? I argue there are also substantial costs to not studying sex differences. Clinically, we suffer from a lack of research on differences in health fields. Academically, we also suffer, with whole fields like evolutionary psychology misinterpreting the study of sex differences. But fixing these disciplines alone will not alleviate the social inflammation which may occur even if good science is done on the issue. The only way to avoid such damage is if, in addition, science communicators and those responsible for informing the public of scientific issues accurately convey the research being done to the public.

	For starters, our misunderstanding of sex differences does harm in health and in the medical establishment. [Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.2217/17455057.4.3.237) looking at gender gaps in medical research reports that men are test subjects far more often in medical research than women are. While this has started to change, there is still much [progress](https://elifesciences.org/articles/56344) to be made. One particular study mentions that the excuse for women’s poor representation is that women have greater variability across many conditions due to their reproductive system, which we now know to be [false](https://journals.lww.com/pain/Fulltext/2005/09000/The_case_for_the_inclusion_of_female_subjects_in.1.aspx). Males too carry their own sources of variation in the form of dominance hierarchies which [alter](https://journals.lww.com/pain/Fulltext/2005/09000/The_case_for_the_inclusion_of_female_subjects_in.1.aspx), for example, men’s pain responses with respect to women’s. But even if we accepted that women had added complexity, shouldn’t they still be included as test subjects? I’m sure that having two eyes and a brain also makes treating people much more difficult, but I haven’t heard of many studies with exclusively [anencephalic](https://www.fetalhealthfoundation.org/fetal-syndromes/anencephaly/) subjects, but this is besides the point. This gender gap, of course, has consequences for treatment of disease. For example, without any analysis of sex differences, we might assume that in the 55-64 age range, males and females carry an equal risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). In reality males have more than [twice the chance](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/39/4/424/4967741) of CHD than females in that age range. Better known are differences in lifespan as females [age more slowly](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21902801/) due to the slower rate of degradation of their telomere caps. 

Closing the gender gap is critical to treating sex-specific diseases or diseases that have sex-specific symptoms. Studies document well the pharmacokinetic (the processing of the drug by the body) and pharmacodynamic (the mechanism of the action of the drug) [differences](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/1201/p1254.html) in the way that drugs affect men and women. Body weight, gastrointestinal motility, and intestinal enzymatic activity are all examples of biological variables that differ between men and women and which have significant effects on the action of drugs on the body. In order to have a better understanding of these sex-specific diseases and treatments, we need to study differences between the sexes more closely. As [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388783/) put it: “Gender medicine must consider the needs of both sexes.”

Academic research, as opposed to clinical research, is also affected by a poor studying of sex differences. One reason for this is that studying higher level phenomena like personality, emotion, mating, and group dynamics is not as cut and dry as studying the molecular mechanisms of drugs discussed earlier, and higher level phenomena is what much academic research on sex differences focuses on. Determining the causes of these and why sex difference occur in them requires a multi-factor approach. These phenomena are often assumed, all too simplistically, to be beholden to the evolutionary-type explanations of the molecular world.

In [one study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-06497-004) looking at the toy preferences of non-human primates, researchers found that the male vervets preferred to play with “construction and transportation” toys, rather than “doll and pot” toys. The explanation for this, they claim, is the presence of male hormones, which alter “the structure and function of the brain systems that subserve the recognition of these object categories’”. But this clearly does not take into account the socialization that has already occurred in both sexes. The vervets, with some up to 185 months old, will have already been significantly influenced by their elders in the male and female-typical behavior, undercutting the hypothesis that these differences are biologically determined. 
 
Criticism can also be extended to entire fields of research which claim to explain sex differences, rather than individual articles that have methodological flaws. Evolutionary psychology is a flagship example of this - the very foundations of the discipline are questionable. Evolutionary psychology proposes that many, if not all, of our behaviors are products of natural selection i.e. are adaptations to the selection pressures of our ancestral environment, or are byproducts of these adaptations. The primary problem with this approach, even supposing we can apply evolutionary arguments here, is that it is extremely difficult to know much about any of our ancestral environments. As a result, the stories that evolutionary psychology proposes are speculative and all too convenient. [One such story](https://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2011)%20The%20recalibrational%20theory%20and%20violent%20anger.pdf) proposed by a paper in the “Aggression and Violent Behavior” journal outlines a “recalibrational theory of anger”, which claims anger is a social strategy used to bargain for better treatment by others or recalibrate the weighting of preferences of other individuals. While intuitive, hypotheses such as these are essentially unfalsifiable that rely on plausibility rather than testability, which is not sufficient for good science. The famous paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould famously referred to these post hoc narratives as just-so stories in reference to Rudyard Kipling’s book “Just So Stories” which made up fantastical explanations for how animals developed their characteristics.

Avoiding the pitfalls of these disciplines may not be enough for the benefits of studying  sex differences to accrue however. What is needed in addition to this are science educators who accurately convey research to the general public. Currently, misinformation about these topics [pervade common platforms](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0119) on the internet and perpetuate false claims. The antidote to clickbait news sites and poor science communication is, of course, good science communication, which requires that those who have expertise in the field write books, record podcasts, and film lectures to educate the public further and be transparent about the current state of the field.
