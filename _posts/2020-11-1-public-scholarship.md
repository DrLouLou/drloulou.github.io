title: The Importance of Studying Sex Differences
---

The study of sex differences often raises legitimate concern. Many scientific fields of the past have fallen victim to pseudoscience and conspiracy theorizing, likely due to the complex social motivations which have underpinned them - two blatant examples of the distorting effect of these influences being the Soviet Union’s Lysenkoism and Nazi Germany’s Aryanism. Given these risks, we must ask ourselves why we want to study sex differences at all, given its potential to be misunderstood by scientists and the public alike. What good could possibly come of it? I think we are disadvantaged in several ways which I will outline and which studying sex differences would help solve. But these will not alleviate the social inflammation which may occur even if good science is done on the issue. The only way to avoid such damage is if science communicators and those responsible for informing the public of scientific issues accurately convey the research being done to the public.

  One important harm being done by our lack of understanding of sex differences is in health and the medical establishment. [Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.2217/17455057.4.3.237) looking at gender gaps in medical research reports that men are disproportionately selected and studied in a wide variety of medical conditions. While this has started to change, there is still much [progress](https://elifesciences.org/articles/56344) to be made. The purported reason for women’s poor representation has been attributed to women’s greater variability across many phenomena due to their reproductive system, which we now know to be [false](https://journals.lww.com/pain/Fulltext/2005/09000/The_case_for_the_inclusion_of_female_subjects_in.1.aspx). Males too carry their own sources of variation in the form of dominance hierarchies which alter, for example, men’s pain responses with respect to women’s. This gender gap, of course, has consequences for treatment of disease. For example, without any analysis of sex differences, we might assume that in the 55-64 age range, males and females carry an equal risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). In reality males have more than [twice the chance](https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/39/4/424/4967741) of CHD than females in that age range. Better known are differences in lifespan as females [age more slowly](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21902801/) due to the slower rate of degradation of their telomere caps. 

Closing the gender gap is critical to treating sex-specific diseases or diseases that have sex-specific symptoms.  It has been well documented that there are pharmacokinetic (the processing of the drug by the body) and pharmacodynamic (the mechanism of the action of the drug) [differences](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/1201/p1254.html) in the way that drugs affect men and women. Body weight, gastrointestinal motility, and intestinal enzymatic activity are all examples of biological variables that differ between men and women and which have significant effects on the action of drugs on the body. In order to have a better understanding of these sex-specific diseases and treatments, we need to study differences between the sexes more  closely. As [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388783/) put it: “Gender medicine must consider the needs of both sexes.”

Now that the benefits of studying sex differences are more evident, we can look closer at the scholarship of the field. Research on sex differences is varied and many aspects of it remain controversial. One reason for this is that studying higher level behavior is not as cut and dry as studying the molecular mechanisms of drugs discussed earlier, and higher level behavior is what much research in sex differences focuses on. It’s even debated what constitutes a good explanation of a phenomenon as we shall see.

When studying behavior, many research articles fail to adjust for all the many factors that contribute to differences in sex. In [one study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-06497-004) looking at the toy preferences of non-human primates, researchers found that the male vervets preferred to play with “construction and transportation” toys, whereas the female vervets preferred to play with the dolls and pot toys. The explanation for this, they claim, is the presence of male hormones, which alter “the structure and function of the brain systems that subserve the recognition of these object categories’”. But this clearly does not take into account the socialization that has already occurred in both sexes. The vervets, with some up to 185 months old, will have already been significantly influenced by their elders in the male and female-typical behavior, undercutting the hypothesis that these differences are biologically determined. 
 
Criticism can also be extended to entire fields of research which claim to explain sex differences, rather than individual articles that have methodological flaws. Evolutionary psychology is a flagship example of this - the very foundations of the discipline are in question. Evolutionary psychology proposes that many, if not all, of our behaviors are products of natural selection i.e. are adaptations to the selection pressures of our ancestral environment, or are byproducts of these adaptations. The primary problem with this approach, even supposing it’s true, is that it is extremely difficult to know much about any of our ancestral environments. As a result, the stories that evolutionary psychology proposes are speculative and all too convenient. [One such story](https://www.cep.ucsb.edu/grads/Sell/(2011)%20The%20recalibrational%20theory%20and%20violent%20anger.pdf) proposed by a paper in the “Aggression and Violent Behavior” journal outlines a “recalibrational theory of anger”, which claims anger is a social strategy used to bargain for better treatment by others or recalibrate the weighting of preferences of other individuals. While intuitive, hypotheses such as these are essentially unfalsifiable that rely on plausibility rather than testability, which is not sufficient for good science. The famous paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould famously referred to these post hoc narratives as just-so stories in reference to Rudyard Kipling’s book Just So Stories which made up fantastical explanations for how animals developed their characteristics.

Avoiding the pitfalls of these disciplines may not be enough for the benefits of studying  sex differences to accrue however. What is needed in addition to this are science educators who accurately convey research to the general public. Currently, misinformation about these topics [pervade common platforms](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0119) on the internet and perpetuate false claims. The antidote to clickbait news sites and poor science communication is, of course, good science communication, which requires that those who have expertise in the field write books, record podcasts, and film lectures to educate the public further and be transparent about the current state of the field.
