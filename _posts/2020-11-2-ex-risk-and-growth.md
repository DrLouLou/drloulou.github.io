title: Existential Risk and Growth
---

Columbia professor Leopold Aschenbrenner [proposed](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Leopold-Aschenbrenner_Existential-risk-and-growth_.pdf) an interesting model for thinking about how risk could vary with growth. Those who worry that exponential growth will lead to humanity's complete self-destruction may have a particular curve in mind where, for each new technology discovered, we inch slightly closer to an inevitable end, whether through nuclear weapons, climate change, or biological weapons. Proponents of this model often encourage stagnation. According to Aschenbrenner, this is the worst thing to do. He acknoweldges that some types of growth can increase existential risk, but argues in favour of a Kuznets-looking curve. He claims that, as countries become richer, people are afforded a shift in values. They tend to prefer long-term safety over immediate consumption in comparison to those who are less well-off. This is due to the diminishing marginal utility of consumption. An extra dollar's worth of consumption equals less and less utility the richer you get. People in this position are simply more able to care about the poor, the environment, and about the potential wellbeing of trillions of people who don't exist yet. It is in the interests of everyone that poverty is alleviated, not merely for the ease and comfort of a life filled with consumption, but for the change in values that confers a greater caution to security. Allocating more resources to technologies associated with our safety is what will reduce risk in the long run. In sum, growth of the consumptive kind is risky. This is the growth that has occurred most in countries until this point. But, some richer countries are starting to allocate resources to technologies associated with our safety e.g. clean energy tech, biosecurity etc... Acclerating growth is important now more than ever to clear the Kuznet peak and reduce the time spent in our "time of perils" as Carl Sagan put it. Whether these security efforts will be enough to counteract the effects of consumption is left ambiguous by Aschenbrenner. But, what we can be sure of is that stagnation **now** will stall our progress in the most dangerous time yet in human history.
