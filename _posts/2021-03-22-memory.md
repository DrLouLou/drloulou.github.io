title: Memory is the Enemy of Understanding
---

Eliezer Yudkowsky once wrote that schools often don't actually test for what they claim. Instead, they allowed students to "guess the teacher's password" - a verbal form of stimulus response association. Rather than actually understanding, a bright student could cobble together a satisfactory response based on verbal and physical clues provided by the teacher. The response of a student to any particular question may appear to have the right words in the right order of the sentence so as to give the impression of understanding, but understanding is not merely a sequence of syllables exiting the mouth. How is it possible to guard against this?

One possible way around this problem is to forget about memory altogether. Memory all too often gives ourselves (not just our teachers) a false impression of understanding. One easy way to test this is to imagine removing an idea from your head and seeing if you can derive it again. You know that
