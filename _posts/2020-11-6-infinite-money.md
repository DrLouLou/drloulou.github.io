title: Infinite Money Hack? 
---

I left secondary school probably in a similar state to most people in the sense that I didn't really have a clue what the e constant was or why it was used. It just seemed to crop up a lot when modeling growth of bacteria or whatnot. To say that it's just a particular irrational number or that it's 2.718... doesn't really convey its significance either, which is not _quite_ as obvious as in the case of other special numbers like pi or i. I've often heard that the best way to learn mathematics (and probably all other subjects too) is to learn each discovery in its appropriate place in the chronology of other discoveries. Essentially, you can understand certain conncepts much more deeply by having a better knowledge of their historical context, which itself gives you a much deeper understanding of the questions being asked at the time, the immediate reason for the discovery, the usefulness of the discovery etc... I will try to explain it in as simple a way as possible. Although e first appeared in a rather inconspicuous way in an appendix of [Napier's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Napier), it wasn't first approximated until 1683 when [Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli) was investigating compound interest. The difference between compound interest and simple interest is that, with compound interest, the rate is applied to the principal amount and the accumulated amount each iteration. For example, if I loaned $1 with a simple interest rate of 10% per year, the amount I received back would accumulate as such: $1.10, $1.20, $1.30... per year. Whereas if I loaned the same amount for a compound interest of 10%, the amount recieved would be: $1.10, $1.21, $1.33(1)... per year as, this time, the rate is acting upon the principal amount plus the further amount recieved each time. But, this assumes the lender is only being credited once per year. What would happen if we were to split the interest rates over the course of the year at a regular interval? In the case of simple interest, nothing special would happen. If our money was returned biannually at 5% every sixth months, our money at the end would be the same as one year of 10%: 0.05(interest rate) * 2(for two 6 month periods) + 1(principal amount) = 0.1(interest rate) * 1 (1 year) + 1. But, if we tried this with compound interest rates, the results would not be equal: 1 * (1.05)^2 != 1.10. At this point, you could ask whether it's possible to have infinite returns if only you made enough intervals. Bankers obviously tried this and the answer is: unfortunately not. You will, however, make an important mathematical discovery. The rate of change will increase slightly but tend towards a particular irrational number (guess what it is). If you took $1 and increased it at a rate of 1% per year in compound fashion, and then tried to increase the number of intervals per year infinitely, you would get a result of e. Like this:
![compound interest table]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/e-equation.webp "compound interest table")
![e equation]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/e-equation.webp "e equation")
e is defined as the limit. So, it can be described as the base rate of growth. It could also be thought of as a unit of rate of growth. In the same way that 1 can scale to all other numbers, e can scale to all other rates of growth. Every continously growing amount can be described in terms of e - it's a common rate, which is likely the reason that it comes up so much. Hopefully this is helpful.
