title: Toughness
---

The other day and after a series of personal troubles, a friend of mine said that she didn't think of herself as very tough. She was obviously quite down, so I tried to say something helpful - not too preachy, but not too trivial. And I think what I said to her was broadly correct (surprisingly). I suggested that, perhaps, toughness was not the extent to which you felt emotional about something, but instead what you thought and how you behaved after experiencing those feelings. 

I think it's helpful to tease apart these two different qualities which are sometimes conflated. The first is how much negative emotion you feel or the frequency of negative thoughts. The second is how you deal with those thoughts. I believe toughness describes the second of those qualities.

You might say that an emotionless automaton, who met no mental resistance whatsoever to any thought or action, could not display the type of mental toughness my friend was talking about. Of course, they could be in physical pain, for example during exercise, but this physical pain would be purely... physical and would not translate into any mental resistance. This creature would not be deterred in the slightest by the agony in its limbs. It would be difficult to describe such effortlessness as *toughness*. After all, there is nothing to struggle through. Maybe the example was too abstract, but it I think it makes more sense to define toughness as the number of hurdles that were overcome successfully. Adversity is a requirement of toughness. In my friend's case, if you took away the negative feelings, there would be nothing to be tough _about_.

The mere existence of negative emotion in a person's life, however, does not necessarily mean that that person is tough. It is entirely possible to collapse or be defeated, however minutely, by each setbacks or obstacle. Setback and obstacles are merely the conditions from which toughness can emerge, your behaviour is what defines whether it actually *does* emerge. Aversion, pessimism, and wallowing self-pity are all common symptoms of a lack of toughness. None of these qualities were on display in my friend's case. Rather, I saw conscientousness and a courageous enthusiasm to not be brought down by difficulties in her life.
