title: Lisp Series Intro

A week or so ago, I came across Eric Steven Raymond's [guide](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) to hacking and hacker culture - a culture of working on difficult, not necessarily software related problems. In the section dedicated to basic hacking skills, Raymond says:

"LISP is worth learning for a different reason â€” the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot."

In an effort to learn more about programming fundamentals, I want to explore Lisp and become very proficient at writing it.

The posts that will follow will be a comprehensive set of my notes on the basics of Lisp programming, including syntax (of which there is not much comparatively), history of the language, and what it does differently to other high level languages (i.e. why it's significant). I will be using many online resources to help me throughout. I will refer to more specific places as they come up, but lots of my info will be collected from the MIT  documentation, books like "Common Lisp the Language" (second edition), and Paul Graham's essays on Lisp (and the incredible amount of articles he links to). Uniquely, there are many dialects of Lisp, I will probably talk about both Scheme and Common Lisp - two of the most frequent dialects. For their differences, I refer to PG's [FAQ]([http://www.paulgraham.com/lispfaq1.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/lispfaq1.html)):

"Common Lisp is powerful but ugly. Scheme is small and clean, but the standard only defines the inner core of the language. If I had to deliver an application I'd probably use Common Lisp; if I were teaching a course I might use Scheme (but with Common Lisp macros)."

The posts will probably vary in length (and there will be many of them) according to how long I can spend sitting down each time, but hopefully they will flow into each other fairly seamlessly :).
